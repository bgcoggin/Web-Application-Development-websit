    <dt><strong>Burn the Ships (2018)</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      This album has powerful themes of redemption, hope, and faith. 
      The title track encourages leaving behind the past and moving forward, 
      and the songs are both uplifting and deeply personal.  
      This album is the main reason I picked them—I don’t really have a favorite music group, 
      but three of my favorite songs are here: <em>Joy</em>, <em>God Only Knows</em>, and <em>Burn the Ships</em>.

    <dt><strong>Run Wild. Live Free. Love Strong. (2014)</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      A breakthrough release that mixes energetic pop-rock with heartfelt lyrics. 
      Tracks like <em>Fix My Eyes</em> show the band’s signature blend of anthemic sound 
      and meaningful storytelling.

    <dt><strong>What Are We Waiting For? (2022)</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      A reflective and timely album addressing themes of unity, love, and perseverance. 
      Songs like <em>Relate</em> highlight the band’s ability to connect with real-world 
      struggles while pointing toward hope.
